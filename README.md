# ClimateFrame
ClimateFrame is a framework that allows you to frame data by defining specific actions that are executed when certain events occur within real time data.


Mission Statement/ Goal:
------------------------
Providing a framework that allows regional experts to communicate their knowledge with local communities.


What a mission statement is:
----------------------------
A concise summary of the aims of a project.


The problem we are trying to solve:
-----------------------------------
Currently local experts have no framework that helps them and allows them to automatically issue warnings or inform communities based on current data 

* Bridging the gap between fragmented datasets and local communities
* Combining datasets and knowledge of local experts
* Providing a common interface for building a message system based on customized datasets


The concrete use case is as follows: 
------------------------------------
* A local expert wants to help vulnerable clients 
* The local expert uses our framework and selects the datasets he/she wants to use
* The local expert knows the vulnerable clients and this specifies messages that will be sent as text messages or ASCII art symbols to the vulnerable clients
* Since the expert knows the local clients he/she gets them to sign up to the service


Markers of Success:
-------------------
* Local experts to feel involved and enthusiastic. 
* We want governments to see our tool as a chance.
* We want to be the go to place for content providers who are looking for a platform to share info
* We want to enable direct stakeholders to share information with communities.

Indirect Stakeholders:
----------------------
* meterologists
* media 
* news agencies
* data providers
* vulnerable communities

Direct Stakeholders:
--------------------
* key people who want to help communities with data
