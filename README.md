# ClimateFrame

ClimateFrame is a framework that allows you to frame data. 

The concrete use case is as follows: 
* A local expert wants to help vulnerable clients 
* The local expert uses our framework and selects the datasets he/she wants to use
* The local expert knows the vulnerable clients and this specifies messages that will be sent as text messages or ASCII art symbols to the vulnerable clients
* Since the expert knows the local clients he/she gets them to sign up to the service
